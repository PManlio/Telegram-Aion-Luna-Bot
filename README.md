# Telegram-Aion-Luna-Bot
This is a Telegram bot I use to send me notification when certain dungeons where i afk (like Luna) are over.

All of the information required are inside the code, main.py

You need this {= https://core.telegram.org/bots} to create a telegram bot

You need all inside the folder to make it run.

If you have any trouble, let me know.

P.S.: This bot was programmed one year ago, at the moment. At that time it worked pretty well; now i don't grant anything
